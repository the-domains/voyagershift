The Jaguar F-Type Coupe made its debut to the world last year in Los 
Angeles and Tokyo, and will hit dealer lots this Spring time. There 
isn't much left to say about the coupe, and one glance at the car 
renders all rational thought about performance and pricing meaningless. 
It's not the fastest to 60, probably won't tackle the twisties as 
elegantly as Cayman, and to get the only one that makes north of 400 
horsepower you have to spend $100,000\. But none of that matters when you
see this thing in the flesh, and hear the engine running at full taps. 
The F-Type Coupe is everything you want from a Jag, and it's the 
antithesis of the Porsche 911\.

Unlike the Porsche, you can get into an F-Type Coupe for just $65,000\. 
That means you'll have to make do with a 340 horsepower V6 and live 
without a few luxuries, but you'l have plenty of power for the street 
and get all the good looks you can handle. Opting for the Type S will 
run you another $12,000, and adds 40 horsepower to the same engine. 
You'll also get a sportier suspension and a nice set of wheels. We 
suspect this is where most buyers will land with the F-Type Coupe. If 
that's not enough, $99,000 will get you into the Type R. Here you'll 
find 550 horsepower at your disposal thanks to a supercharged V8, along 
with some torque vectoring and a few aggressive bits tacked onto the 
body.

None of them break the 4 second barrier en route to 60, and none are 
particularly featherweights, but we'd wager you'll have just as much fun
in this thing as nearly anything else on the road. You'll probably look
better doing it, too.
